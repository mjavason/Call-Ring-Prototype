Instructions
Open the HTML file in two different browsers or tabs.
On both clients, click the "Start" button to start the local video stream.
On one client (the caller), click the "Call" button. Copy the generated offer from the "Offer" textarea.
Paste the offer into the "Offer" textarea on the other client (the answerer), and click the "Answer" button. Copy the generated answer from the "Answer" textarea.
Paste the answer into the "Answer" textarea on the caller client.
This setup will establish a WebRTC connection between the two clients, enabling video streaming between them.

Note: This example uses a STUN server (stun:stun.l.google.com:19302) for NAT traversal. For production use, you should consider using a TURN server as well for better connectivity.
